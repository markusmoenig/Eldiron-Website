Dear Internet.

I am sorry for the long delay. Eldiron was way much more work as expected, especially due to the internal multi-player design.

I have now released v0.70, an official pre-release with missing features. But it is supported and future versions will be backwards compatible.

You can download it for Windows and macOS here on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/markusmoenig/Eldiron/releases).

Linux binaries will be added soon!

Thanks so much for your support and as always you can contact me directly on Discord for support or questions.

Upwards and onwards!

Moody
