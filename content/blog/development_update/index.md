All is going well and I hope to provide a public pre-release within the next 1-2 months. The core components are done, now it is mostly about fleshing out the node and scripting systems which make up the gameplay (which is quite fun).

### What I am working on

Many components need some more attention, like the integrated code editor for example, there are of course bugs and the UI need some more work, however it is all coming together nicely at the moment.

Thanks for your interest and please stay in touch via Discord.
