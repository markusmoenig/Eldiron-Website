The new tile-map has more details, both focus on Ultima 4 / 5 style tiles and are production quality. As always the tile-map is MIT licensed and the full source files can be downloaded here.
Next I started with player handling. Although Eldiron already has a quite powerful node system I mostly focused on NPC behavior (Non-Player-Characters) so far.</description></item><item><title>Development Update</title><link>https://eldiron.com/blog/development_update_04_28_22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eldiron.com/blog/development_update_04_28_22/</guid><description>Eldiron v0.5 Newly added features:
